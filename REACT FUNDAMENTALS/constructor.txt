 - Constructor - 
 The constructor is a special method that is called to initalize an object state in class.
 It is automatically called  during the creation of an object in class.

 Example:
 Constructor(props){
    super(props);
 }

 In Reactjs , constructor are mainly used to -
 1. It is used for intializing the local state of the component by assigning an object in this state.
 2. It is used for binding event handler methods that accure in your component.

 Example:
 App.js 
    import React, { Component } from 'react';
    class App extends Component {
      constructor(props){
          super(props);
          this.state = {
              name: 'AdvaithRPai'
          }
          this.handleEvent = this.handleEvent.bind(this);
      }
        handleEvent(){
            console.log(this.props);
        }
        render() {
            return (
            <div className = 'App'>
            <h3>React Constructor</h3>
            <input type = 'text' value = {this.state.data} />
            <button onClick = {this.handleEvent}>Click Me</button>
            </div>
            )
        }
    }
    export default App
// In the above example, we have created a constructor and set the state in it.

Main.js 
import React from 'react';
import ReactDom from 'react-dom';
import App from '/App.js';
ReactDom.render(<App/>,
document.getElementById('app'));
// In the Main.js file, we have imported the App component and rendered it in the root element of the HTML file.
