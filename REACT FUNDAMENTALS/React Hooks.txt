- React Hooks -
Hooks are a new feature introduced in Reactjs.
It allows you to use state and other React features without writing a class.

- Rules of Hooks -
1. Only call Hooks at the top level.
2. Only call Hooks from React function components.

- Hooks State - 
Hooks state is the new way of declaring a state in Reactjs.
Hook uses useState() hook for setting and retrieving the state.

Example:

App.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';
function CountApp(){
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    return(
        <div>
            <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
            <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
        </div>
    )
}
export default CountApp;
// In the above example, we have created a state called count and set it to 0.
// We have also created a function called setCount that updates the count state.
// We have also created a button that calls the setCount function when clicked.
// When the button is clicked, the count state is updated and the UI is updated.
// This is the new way of declaring a state in Reactjs.
