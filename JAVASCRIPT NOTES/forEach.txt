- forEach Method -

buyButtons.forEach(function(buyButton) {
  console.log('Binding the buy button');
  buyButton.addEventListener("click", buyItem);
});

If you refresh the page, you will see the "Binding the buy button" text was triggered 10 times and 
if you click each of the buttons, you should see the text BUYING ITEM logged 10 times.

Similarly, if you want to remove the event listener from each of those, you have to loop over each of them as well.
