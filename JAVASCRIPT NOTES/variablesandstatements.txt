- Variables and Statements - 
There are three different ways to maek a variable, which in JavaScript we refer to as declaring a variable.
1. var
2. let
3. const

- var -
To  declare a variable using var, we use the keyword var followed by the name of the variable.

eg: var name = "Memento";

- let -
let is a newer way to declare variables.
It is block scoped, meaning it is only accessible within the block it is declared in.
eg: let name = "Memento";

- const -
const is a newer way to declare variables.
It is also block scoped, but it is used to declare variables that are not meant to be reassigned.
eg: const name = "Memento";

The namings of these aren't great. 
Const means constant, but it's still called a variable.

- Differences -
The values of var and let can be updated and reassigned.
The value of const cannot be reassigned.
