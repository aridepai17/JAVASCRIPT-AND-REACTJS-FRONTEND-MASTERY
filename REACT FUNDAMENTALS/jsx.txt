JSX 
JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is similar in appearance to HTML, hence provides a way easily write HTML in React.
Extension of JavaScript syntax
Makes your React code look simpler and more readable

eg: 
const elem = <h1>Hello World!</h1>;
const elem = <h1>React was released in {2010 + 3}</h1>;

const name = "CWH";
const elem = <h1>My name is {name}</h1>;

const elem = <h1>Hello {name ? name : 'World'}</h1>;

It is faster than regular JavaScript because it performs optimization while translating the code to JavaScript.
Instead of separating technologies by putting markup and logic in separate files, Reactjs uses component that contain both, we will learn components.
It is type-safe, and most errors can be found at compile time.
It makes easier to create a template.
