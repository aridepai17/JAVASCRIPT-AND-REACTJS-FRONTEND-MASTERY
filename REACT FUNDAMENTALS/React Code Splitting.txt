- React Code Splitting - 
The react app bundles their files using tools like Webpack or Browsefy.
Bundling is a process which takes multiple files and merge them into a single file, which is called a bundle.
The bundle is responsible for loading an entire app at once on the webpage.

Code splitting improves -
1. Performance of the app
2. The impact on the memor
3. The downloadable kilobytes size 

- React.lazy() -
The best way for code splitting into the app is through the dynamic import() syntax.
The React.lazy() function allows us to render a dynamic import as a regular component.
