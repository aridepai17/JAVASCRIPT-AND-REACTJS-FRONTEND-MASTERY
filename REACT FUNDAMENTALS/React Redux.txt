- React Redux - 
Redux was inspired by Flux.
Redux studied the Flux architecture and made it simpler.

1. Redux does not have a dispatcher concept.
2. Redux has a single store whereas Flux has multiple stores.
3. The Action objects will be received and handled directly by the store.

- Store -
The store is a single object that holds the entire state of the application.
The store is the place where the entire state of your applcation lists.
It manages the status of the applcation and has a dispatch function.
It is like a brain responsible for all moving parts in Redux.

- Action -
Action is sent or dispatched from the view has which are payloads that can be read by Reducers
It is pure object created to the store the information of user events.
It includes information such as type of achieve time of occurances, location of occurances, its coordinates and which state it aims to change.

- Reducer -
Reducer reads teh payload from the action and then updates the store via the state accordingly. 
It is pure function to reach a new state from the previous state.
