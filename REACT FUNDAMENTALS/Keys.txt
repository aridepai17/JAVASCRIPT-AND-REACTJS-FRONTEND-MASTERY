- React Keys -
A key is unique identifier.
In React, It is used to identify which items have changed, updated or deleted from the lists. 
It is useful when we dynamically created component in a collection need to be rendered instead of re-rendering the entire set of component every time.

Example:
const StringList = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F'];
const updatedList = StringList.map((StringList) => <li key={StringList}>{StringList}</li>);

// In the above example, we have created a list called StringList and passed a list of strings to it.
// updatedList is a new list of strings with a unique key for each string.

If there are not stable IDs for rendering items, you can assign the item index as a key of lists.
It can be shown in the below example.

const StringList = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F'];
const updatedList = StringList.map((StringList, index) => <li key={index}>{StringList}</li>);
