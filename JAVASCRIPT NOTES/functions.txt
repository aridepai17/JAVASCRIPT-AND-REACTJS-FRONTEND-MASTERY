- Functions -
A function can do anything, and the real power of JavaScript comes when you define your own functions.
Functions are a way to group code together and give it a name.

- Defining a Function - 
First you type function and then the name of the function.
Example: 
// function definition
function calculateBill() {
  // this is the function body
  console.log("Running Calculate Bill!!");
}

// function call or function invocation
calculateBill();

- Returning Values -

function calculateBill() {
  console.log("Running Calculate Bill!!");
  const total = 100 * 1.13;
  console.log(total);
  return total;
}
myBill = calculateBill();
console.log(`Total: ${myBill}`); // Total: 113

Variables that are created inside of a function are only available within that function, which is called block scoping.
It is not available outside of it.
When we called calculateBill() earlier, we got undefined returned in the console. To fix that, we need to return total.
return is a keyword in JavaScript.

The total variable is still not available to us. That is because we need to capture (another buzz word) the result of the function or capture the returned value of the function into a variable.
That will print out the value and message in the console.

You may be wondering why we have two variables to hold the same value, total within calculateBill() and myTotal below the function.
The reason is that total variable is a temporary variable.
Since total is created inside of the function, it is only ever available inside of calculateBill and when the function is done running, that variable is cleaned up (or what is called garbage collected in JavaScript and it's no longer needed).
If you ever want to capture the value returned from calculateBill(), you have to stick it into a variable before you can go ahead and display it.


- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) -
DRY is a programming principle that states that you should not repeat yourself.
This means that you should not write the same code over and over again.
Instead, you should create a function that does the work for you.

function calculateBill(billAmount, taxRate) {
  const total = billAmount ( 1 + taxRate );
  console.log(total);
  return total;
}
myTotal1 = calculateBill(100, 1.13);
myTotal2 = calculateBill(200, 1.13);
myTotal3 = calculateBill(300, 1.13);
console.log(myTotal1, myTotal2, myTotal3); // 113 226 339

- Function Expression -
A function expression is a way to define a function and assign it to a variable.

eg:
const doctorize = function(firstName){
    return `Dr. ${firstName}`;
}

- Difference between Function Declaration and Function Expression -
HOISTING
There is only one real difference which is how they operate in something called hoisting.


doctorize("wes");
doctorize2("wes");

const doctorize = function (firstName) {
  return `Dr. ${firstName}`;
};

function doctorize2 (firstName) {
  return `Dr. ${firstName}`;
}

Why does a function declaration work if you call it before you define it, 
but a function expression does not, especially when we created the exact same function in both cases?
Functions that are declared with the function keyword are called hoisted.
Hoisting is more of an interview question that you may be asked.

Essentially it means that JavaScript will take functions and bring them up to the top of the code before they are called. 
This gives us the ability to run a function before it is defined.

- Arrow Functions -
The next way to make a function is using an arrow function.
Arrow functions themselves have a few different ways of being declared.
They are a newer addition to JavaScript, and were added in the last couple of years.
Benefits -
1. They are concise syntax and tend to be shorter
2. They allow for writing one line functions
3. do not have their own scope in reference to the this keyword

Arrow functions are also anonymous functions, 
which means there is no way to declare an arrow function the way we do a function declaration function doctorize() {..}. 
You always have to stick it into a variable.

eg: function inchToCM(inches){
    const cm = inches * 2.54;
    return cm;
}
This takes 4 lines of code 

const inchToCM = function (inches) {
    return inches * 2.54;
}
Takes 2 lines of code and all we have done is turned it into an anonymous function and stored it in a variable.

- Diffirent ways to write an Arrow Function -
Now we will go to the right of the parenthesis and add what is called a fat arrow =>.
In programming, -> is referred to as a skinny arrow and => is referred to as a fat arrow.

const inchToCM = (inches) => {
    return inches * 2.54;
}

- Implicit and Explicit Returns -
An explicit return is when you type the return keyword before returning a value such as -
eg: return inch * 2.54;

An implicit return is returning it without actually having to type the keyword return. 
Arrow functions allow us to use implicit returns.
eg: const inchToCM = (inches) => {
  return inches * 2.54;
};
To get rid of the explicit return:
- first put the function on one line
- then delete the curly brackets{ }
- finally, delete the return keyword

const inchToCM = (inches) => inches * 2.54;

What we did there is:
- we made an arrow function inchToCM which takes in one parameter, inches
- modified the function to implicitly return the value.

The way we can tell this is an implicit return is that:
- it's all on one line
- there is no return keyword
- there are no curly brackets

Finally, and this is more of a stylistic choice, if there is only ever one parameter for your function, 
ou can actually get rid of the parenthesis around the parameter as well.

const inchToCM = inches => inches * 2.54;

For codes containing more than one parameter, we need to use parenthesis and more than one return statement.
eg: function makeABaby(first, last) {
        const baby = {
        name: `${first} ${last}`,
        age: 0,
    };
  return baby;
} 
can be made into 
const makeABaby = (first, last) => ({ name: `${first} ${last}`, age: 0 });

Now... is there a benefit of having the function this way or how we did it originally?
You're not really getting much benefit, in fact the way we had it originally was a bit more readable.
There is nothing wrong with doing a regular function, because you want to think about your future self.

- IIFE (iffy) -
An IIFE is a function that is an immediately invoked function expression.
 Example:
function(){
  console.log('Running the Anon function');
  return `You are cool`;
}

Another way to run this function is what is called an immediately invoked functional expression:

(function () {
  console.log("Running the Anon function");
  return `Your are cool`;
})();

What is the benefit of doing something like that?
It used to be very popular before we had modules and block scope.

- Methods -
A method is simply a function that lives inside of an object.

If we take a look at the function console.log in the browser, we will see that he has been lying to us.
log() is actually the function that lives inside of console, and console is actually an object.

We have a special word to describe functions that live inside of an object and we call those methods.

Example:
const wes = {
  name: "Wes Bos",
  sayHi: function () {
    console.log("Hey wes!");
    return "Hey Wes!";
  },
};
wes.sayHi() is a method. You make it a property on your object and you set it to a function.

const wes = {
  name: "Wes Bos",
  // Method!
  sayHi: function sayHi() {
    console.log("Hey Wes!");
    return "Hey Wes!";
  },
  //Short hand Method
  yellHi() {
    console.log("HEY WESSSSS");
  },
};
If you refresh the browser and type wes.yellHi(), it will work.
What we did here is instead of writing sayHi: function() (which does work), we can get rid of the function keyword and the :. 
That makes it into a property, yellHi(), which is set to the function yellHi.

There is another way, which is an arrow function.
const wes = {
  name: 'Wes Bos',
  // Method!
  sayHi: function sayHi() {
    console.log('Hey Wes!');
    return 'Hey Wes!';
  },
  // Short hand Method
  yellHi() {
    console.log('HEY WESSSSS');
  },
  // Arrow function
  whisperHi: () => {
     console.log('hiii wess im a mouse');
  }
};

whisperHi() is an arrow function that doesn't take any arguments, but it could take in arguments if you wanted.
Those are 3 different ways to do methods and the shorthand is the most common way.

- Callback Functions -
So a callback function is just a regular function, but we use that name for something that will happen after something is done.
The easiest way to define a callback function is either when someone clicks something, run this. 
Or when this amount of time has passed, run this.
What you need to know is that a callback function is a function that gets passed into another function and then it is called by the browser at a later point in time.

1. Click Callback
Example:
const button = document.querySelector(".clickMe");
button.addEventListener("click", wes.sayHi);

When that click happens, we can pass it to any function that we want.
What is happening there is that .addEventListener() is an event listener that we are listening for a click on, and the callback function is wes.sayHi().
It's a function that we give it access to.
Notice that we are not running it there, we are just saying here is the function, when someone clicks the button, please call it.
That is what is referred to as a callback function.

2. Timer Callback
There are a couple of ways to do timers, but the most common way is to use setTimeout().
It takes two things:
1. a function to call after a certain amount of time
2. a duration in milliseconds (after how long should I run this)

Example:
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("DONE TIME TO EAT");
}, 1000);

This will run the function after 1 second.

The difference between a method and a function is that a method is just a function that lives inside of an object.

const wes = new Object({
  name: "wes",
  propertyToCheck: "NEVER",
  age,
  "cool-dude": true,
  "really cool": false,
  "777": true,
  dog: "snickers",
  clothing: {
    shirts: 10,
    pants: 2
  },
  sayHello: function(greeting = "Hey") {
    return `${greeting} ${this.name}`;
  }
});

You may be working what is the this keyword that you use in the sayHello function when you call ${this.name}.
Like we have mentioned in the past, when you take a look at a method, and if you look to the left of the dot, this will always be equal to the left of the dot.
So in this case, ${this.name} is going to be equal to "wes" because that is the value of the name property on our object.
You can access the other properties using the this keyword too.

The reason you use the this keyword instead of using ${wes.name} within the sayHello function is because when we get into prototyping, you are going to see how you can use methods like sayHello on multiple people rather than just on a person named wes.

- Spread Operator -
The easiest way to copy something is via something called a spread.
A spread is a three dot operator and it's used for taking every single item in a object and spreading it into a new object.

const person1 = {
  first: "wes",
  last: "bos",
  clothing: {
    shirts: 10,
    pants: 2
  }
};

const person3 = { ...person1 };
person3.first = Larry;

What you are doing there is you are assigning the variable person3 to a new object using the object literal syntax, and then using the spread operator within the object literal to copy person1.
If you log person3, you will see that it has the same properties as person1.
That is because the spread operator will take every single item that is in an object and spread it into the next object.
One thing to do note is that the spread operator only goes one level deep.

If you do want to do a deep clone or a deep copy of an object, of all of the properties, there are a number of different ways to do it.
The most popular way is most likely to use something called a utility library.

- Lodash -
Lodash is a library that you can include into your script.
It has a lot of methods that are used when working with objects and arrays.

<script src="https://unpkg.com/lodash@4.17.15/lodash.js"></script>
Now if you type _. in your console, you will see that all of the lodash values are available to us.

const person3 = _.cloneDeep(person1);
person3.first = 'Larry';
person3.clothing.shirts = 100;

person1.clothing.shirts still equals 10, because you performed a deep clone using the lodash method 
and then modified the value only for the person3 object because person3 was no longer a reference to person1.

Lodash also has methods for working with arrays.
