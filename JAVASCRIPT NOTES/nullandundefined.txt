- Null and Undefined -
There are two ways to sort of express "nothing" in JavaScript, and that is with undefined and null.

- Undefined -
If you create a variable and don't set anything to it, it will be undefined.
eg: let name;
console.log(name); // undefined

undefined is something that has been created (a variable), but has not yet been defined (given a value).
The same thing goes for properties on an object. If you type in the console person.dog it will return undefined.
Why? Because there is nothing there. That is what undefined is.
It comes about when you try to access a variable that has been created but not given a value.

- Null -
Null is a value of nothing, whereas undefined is a variable that has not yet had a value set to it.
Example:
let firstname;
let name = null;
console.log(firstname); // undefined
console.log(name); // null
