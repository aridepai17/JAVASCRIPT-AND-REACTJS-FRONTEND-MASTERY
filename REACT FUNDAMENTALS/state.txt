- React State -
The state is an updated structure that is used to contain data or information about the component.
The state in component can change over time. The state in change over time happen as a response ot user action or system event.
A state must be kept as simple as possible.
It can be state by using the setState() method and calling setState() method will re-render the component and trigger the UI updates.
A state represents the component's local state of information.
To state an intial state before any interaction, we need to use the getInitialState() method.  

- Defining State -
To define a state, you have to first declare a default set of values for the defining the components initial state.

Example:
import React, { Component } from 'react';
class App extends React Component {
    constructor(){
        super();
        this.state = { displayBio: true };
    }
    render(){
        const bio = this.state.displayBio ! (
            <div>My name is Advaith R Pai</div>
            return(
                <div>
                  <h1>Welcome to React</h1>
                  {bio}
                </div>
            )
        )
    }
}
export default App;
// In the above example, we have created a state called displayBio and set it to true. 
When the component is rendered, the value of displayBio is checked and if it is true, the bio will be displayed.

- Changing State -
We can change the component state y using setState() method and passing a new state object to it.
Create a new method toggle-DisplayBio() and in the above example.

Example:
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class App extends React.Component {
    constructor(){
        super();
        this.state = { displayBio: false };
        console.log('Component this', this);
        this.toggleDisplayBio = this.toggleDisplayBio.bind(this);
    }
    toggleDisplayBio(){
        this.setState({ displayBio: !this.state.displayBio });
    }
    render(){
        const bio = this.state.displayBio ? (
            <div>My name is Advaith R Pai</div>
        ) : null;
        return(
            <div>
                <h1>Welcome to React</h1>
                {bio}
                <button onClick={this.toggleDisplayBio}>Toggle Bio</button>
            </div>
        )
    }
}
export default App;
// In the above example, we have created a method called toggleDisplayBio() which will toggle the value of displayBio state. 
When the button is clicked, the toggleDisplayBio() method is called and the state is updated.
