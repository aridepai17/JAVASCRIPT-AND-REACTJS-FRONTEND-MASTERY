- Objects -
Objects in JavaScript are the biggest building block and almost everything in JavaScript is an object.
Objects are used for collections of data or collections of functionality.
You need to know that when something is an object in JavaScript, it's because we want to group things together.

Example 
const person = {
    first: 'James',
    last: 'Bond',
    age: 30,
}

console.log(person.first); // James
console.log(person.last); // Bond
console.log(person.age); // 30
