- Objects -
Objects in JavaScript are the biggest building block and almost everything in JavaScript is an object.
Objects are used for collections of data or collections of functionality.
You need to know that when something is an object in JavaScript, it's because we want to group things together.

Example 
const person = {
    first: 'James',
    last: 'Bond',
    age: 30,
}

console.log(person.first); // James
console.log(person.last); // Bond
console.log(person.age); // 30

Objects are another fundamental building block of JavaScript, 
just like strings, numbers and booleans. Actually, almost everything in JavaScript is an object.

Objects allow us to group together properties and values, or keys and values is what they are often called (throughout the course Wes will be saying properties and values).
Objects have many uses from storing related data to storing functionality, all the way through to creating your own custom types.
Objects are used for when the order of the properties does not matter.

- Creating an object - 
const person = new Object({
  name: "wes",
  age: 100
});

The property is on the left, and then there is a colon and then we have the value on the right.
The values of an object can be any type (string, function, boolean, other objects, arrays etc).


const person = new Object({
  name:'wes',
  age,
  'cool-dude': true,
  'really cool dude': false,
  '777': true,
});

After each property, you might notice that we add a comma.
recommends adding a comma after the last property in the object, even if there is nothing that comes after it.
That is what is called a trailing comma or a comma dangle.
It's not totally necessary, but putting a trailing comma on there will make sure that the next time you come around and add in a property, we can easily add it.
What happens all the time is if you don't leave a trailing comma, the next time you go to add a property it's very easy to forget to include the comma.

Other things you can do is add nested properties or nested objects.

const person = new Object({
  name: "wes",
  age,
  "cool-dude": true,
  "really cool": false,
  "777": true,
  dog: "snickers",
  clothing: {
    shirts: 10,
    pants: 2
  }
});

As you can see, now the person object has a nested object clothing which has shirt and pants properties.
You can nest objects as deep as you could possibly want.

You can add new properties to an object even after it has been created, using the dot notation.
person.job = 'Web Developer';
Now if you were to take a look at it in the console, you will see the job property has been added and is now part of the object.

Even though properties on the wes object can change, the actual object itself will can never be overwritten entirely.
If you do ever want to freeze the values in an object, what you can do is create a frozen object.

const wesFroze = Object.freeze(wes);

That will freeze the original object wes, and return it. In this case, wes and wesFroze are exact same objects.
freeze() returns the exact same object that was passed into the function. It does not create a copy.
The word in programming that we use to describe something that cannot be changed is immutable. Mutation is changing a value.

- Accessing properties -
You simply write the object name then a set of square brackets, and between the square brackets you give the property name in strings, like so -
console.log(wes.age);
console.log(wes["age"]);

const wes = new Object({
  name: "wes",
  propertyToCheck: "NEVER",
  age,
  "cool-dude": true,
  "really cool": false,
  "777": true,
  dog: "snickers",
  clothing: {
    shirts: 10,
    pants: 2
  }
});
If the property name is stored in a variable, you must use square brackets.
There is another reason, which sometimes the properties of your object are not referenceable via JavaScript, and instead you have to use a string.


However, if you try to access a nested property on a property that does not exist, it will throw an error.
That is because there is no property that exists on that undefined value.
Because wes.jobs is undefined, there are no properties that live inside of that.

- Deleting Properties -
To delete a property object you use the delete keyword.
console.log(delete wes.job);
Now if you take a look, you will see it is undefined.

- Objects Static Methods -

const meats = {
  beyond: 10,
  beef: 5,
  pork: 7,
};

You use Object.entries() when you want to put both the keys and values into an array like so:
console.log(Object.entries(meats)); // [ [ 'beyond', 10 ], [ 'beef', 5 ], [ 'pork', 7 ] ]

console.log(Object.entries(meats)); // [ [ 'beyond', 10 ], [ 'beef', 5 ], [ 'pork', 7 ] ]
console.log(Object.keys(meats)); // [ 'beyond', 'beef', 'pork' ]
console.log(Object.values(meats)); // [ 10, 5, 7 ]

As you can see, keys() is going to give us an array of all the object keys, values() will give us an array of all the values and entries() is going to give us an array where each item is then a nested second array inside of it where the first item in the nested array is the key and the second item is the value.
These are pretty common things to do.

One pretty common way to work with those is using the forEach.
Object.values(meats).forEach(qty => {
  console.log(qty); // 10, 5, 7
});

That is a pretty common thing to do it you want to like loop over and add up how much inventory you have or you want to add up all the numbers.

Object.keys(meats).forEach(qty => {
  console.log(qty); // beyond, beef, pork
});

Object.entries(meats).forEach(([key, value]) => {
  console.log(key, value); // beyond 10, beef 5, pork 7
});

For each one, you get an array with 2 items.
The first item is always going to be the key, and the second item will always be the value.

const key = entry[0];
const value = entry[1];
console.log(key, value); // beyond 10, beef 5, pork 7

Something that we have talked about that is very useful in this scenario is destructuring.
const [key, value] = entry;
What that code is doing is it is taking the first item in the entry array and assigning it to the variable key and it's taking the second item and assigning it to the variable value.

That is the exact same thing as -
const key = entry[0];
const value = entry[1];
