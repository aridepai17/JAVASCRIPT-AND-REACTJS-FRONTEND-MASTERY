- React Higher-Order Component -
It is also know as HOC.
In React, HOC is an advanced technique for reusing component logic.
It is a function that takes a component and returns a new component.

const NewComponent = higherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent){
...
}

HOC.js 
import React from 'react';
export default function HOC(HOCComponent){
    return class extends Component {
        render(){
            return(
                <div>
                    <HOCComponent> </HOCComponent>
                </div>
            )
        }
    }
}

App.js 
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import HOC from './HOC.js';

class App extends Component{
    render(){
        return(
            <div>
                <h1>Higher Order Component</h1>
                <HOCComponent />
            </div>
        )
    }
}

App = HOC(App);
export default App;

// In the above example, we have created a higher order component called HOC which takes a component as an argument and returns a new component.
// The HOC component is then used in the App component.
// The HOC component is used to wrap the App component and return a new component.
// The HOC component can be used to add additional functionality to the App component.
