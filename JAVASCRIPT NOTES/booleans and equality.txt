- Types: Booleans and Equality -

- Booleans -
The final type in JavaScript is called a boolean. A boolean is either true or false, it's like a light switch, it's on or off and that is it.
We use booleans for logic such as if statements in our JavaScript code.
Booleans can be manually set or calculated.

Example:
const isTrue = true;
const isFalse = false;

const age = 18;
const isAdult = age > 18;
console.log(isAdult); // false

- Equality -
1. ' = '
One equal sign = is used to assign a value to a variable
eg: const name = "Memento";
eg: const age = 18;
eg: const isAdult = age > 18;

2. ' == '
Two equal signs == is used to compare two values and check if they are equal.
eg: console.log(1 == 1); // true
eg: console.log(1 == 2); // false
eg: console.log(1 == "1"); // true

3. ' === '
Three equal signs === is used to compare two values and check if they are equal and of the same type.
eg: console.log(1 === 1); // true
eg: console.log(1 === 2); // false
eg: console.log(1 === "1"); // false

For double equals == and triple equals ===, know that you should almost always be using triple equals.
There are some edge cases where you can use double equals, but almost all the time it's better to use triple equals.
Triple equals will always check for both value and type.
